## Music library viewer

This page is hosted on GitHub Pages. You can access it at https://elliotdickman.github.io/music_library/.

Just press the "Get albums" button to fetch and display the music library data.

The only external library I used was jQuery, because it has easy functions for handling JSON data. It's also just cleaner than vanilla Javascript for editing DOM elements. Other than that it's all vanilla HTML, CSS, JS.
